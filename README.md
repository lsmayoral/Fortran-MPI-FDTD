# Fortran-MPI-FDTD
Fortran-MPI-FDTD contains the implementation of Finite Difference in Time Domain (FDTD) method c oded in Fortran90 to solve Maxwell's equations for a given geometry in a parallel computing envi ronment using Message Passage Interface (MPI).

This software package is coded using Object Oriented Paradigm (OOP), modules for Fortran90 language.

There are no system requirements, beside of a fortran compiler with MPI capabilities, which make this project very portable and no need of admin privilegies when used in a production cluster
